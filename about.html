  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a recent high school graduate from India with a strong interest in computer systems,
    information technology, and software development.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interest in computing started through formal education and gradually expanded through
    self-learning, online courses, and hands-on practice in programming and web development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy understanding how systems work behind the scenes and continuously seek opportunities
    to strengthen my technical foundation.
